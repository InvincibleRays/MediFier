Inspiration
The need for a collected medical search system inspired us to work on this. Health is a very important topic and the struggles in finding a nearby GP and things as such has something we often heard around us so we thought of solving this issue to the best of our abilities.

What it does
This is basically a website that allows 2 major functions that are related to a search system and a chat bot. The search bar on the website requires a UK Postcode address and the website fetches 5 closest General Practitioner hospitals from the NHS search system (from the postcode) and displays it. As for the chat bot, it asks for the postcode and provides the nearest hospitals to the user's postcode.

How we built it
The languages we used were HTML, Python, CSS & JavaScript. We created a collaborative GitHub repository and uploaded our work there in sync.

Challenges we ran into
There were many challenges we ran into individually and as a team. One for example was, finding it extremely tough to convert web scraped data from python to JavaScript due to Json errors we were encountering.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
Completing the website look and chatbot look was one of the best things about it. But more than that, being able to successfully scrap data from a website that does not have a specific API was very satisfying.

What we learned
We learned the importance of planning and working on time constraint for such long hours.

What's next for MediFier
Updates to refine the website and backend could be done but that'll depend on the team and whether we want to continue on this.
